# AniSuccess

The **AniSuccess** project uses machine learning to predict whether an anime will be successful based on features like genre, studio, rating, and more. Success is defined by factors such as high ratings, popularity, and audience engagement.

This tool is designed for anime studios, streaming platforms, and fans to understand what drives success in anime. It includes:

- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing anime metadata.
- **Model Training**: Training a predictive model using XGBoost.
- **API Deployment**: Deploying the model as an API with Flask for real-time predictions.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Using Docker and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for easy deployment and scalability.

This project helps make data-driven decisions about anime production and marketing.
